    <h2>December 17, 1971</h2>
    <h3>The last articles!</h3>
    <p>Just 12 days after the publication of this issue, I was at Ft. Dix again, this time to process
        out of active duty. I had come full circle after an unexpected adventure that lasted one year, ten months
        and 28 days. In those days no one greeted returning soldiers, at least not in a positive way. The last interaction at Ft. Dix was a cash payment of all that I was owed (about $400 as I recall).  Now unemployed, I had to figure out what to do with the rest of my life, or at least the next
        couple of
        months. The writing skills I learned in the Army would play a big part in my immediate future.</p>
