        <h2>March 5, 1971</h2>
        <h3>Trip to the "Zone".</h3>
        <p>Twice each year, the our battalion traveled by convoy from Berlin, through occupied East
            Germany, to the U. S. Army training area in Hoenfels, West Germany. Hoenfels is located 60 miles from the
            Czech border, which in those days was not super friendly with the U. S. Army. It was (and still is) about 60
            miles southwest of Nuremberg. The trip from Berlin (about 300 miles) took three days. I was assigned as the
            Battalion Commander's sedan driver, so I got to drive a car while many other soldiers were in trucks, some
            of them in the back sitting on wooden benches. What fun!.</p>
