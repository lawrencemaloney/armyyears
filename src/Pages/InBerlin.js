            When I arrived in Germany in early July 1970, the world's attention
            was firmly focused on the war in Vietnam. At that time, the casualty
            figures exceeded 1.5 million people killed (50,000 U.S., 254,000
            South Vietnamese, 849,000 North Vietnamese military personnel, and
            400,000 North and South Vietnamese civilians).

            The conflicting world views and political ambitions of the U.S. and
            the Soviet Union, which contributed to the escalating involvement of
            the U.S. in the Vietnam War, had their genesis in post-war Germany.
            Fundamental philosophical differences regarding how people should be
            governed, at the root of the conflict in Vietnam, were earlier made
            manifest to the world in post-war Berlin.

            Immediately after Germany's unconditional surrender on May 7, 1945,
            the Soviet Union focused on exacting punishment and reparations for
            atrocities suffered during the German invasion of Russia. The Soviet
            plan included moving skilled workers and other valuable German
            assets to Soviet-controlled countries while leaving the remaining
            German people to fend for themselves with few agricultural,
            industrial, or medical resources.

            The Western Allies, led by the U.S., focused on building up the West
            German state for humanitarian, economic, and political reasons. A
            stable, self-sufficient West Germany could eventually feed itself,
            significantly reducing the money required from other nations to feed
            so many people. The Western Allies also reasoned that a strong West
            Germany would provide a buffer between the Soviet-controlled
            countries and the rest of Europe.

            These conflicting philosophies and ambitions had their focal point
            in Berlin. For civilians and military personnel living in Berlin,
            the potential for armed conflict was personal and ever-present.

            Before arriving in Berlin, I hadn't given much thought to the "Cold
            War" or the precarious position that the Western Allies' military
            personnel, their families, and other civilians found themselves in,
            living 100 miles inside the Soviet-controlled sector of post-war
            Germany. I was about to become part of a "community" surrounded by a
            belligerent cold war enemy, supported by Soviet Union and East
            German troops.
