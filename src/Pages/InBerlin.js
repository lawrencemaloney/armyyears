            When I arrived in Germany in early July 1970, the world's attention
            was firmly focused on the war in Vietnam. At that time, the casualty
            figures exceeded 1.5 million people killed (50,000 U.S., 254,000
            South Vietnamese, 849,000 North Vietnamese military personnel, and
            400,000 North and South Vietnamese civilians).

            The conflicting world views and political ambitions of the U.S. and
            the Soviet Union, which contributed to the escalating involvement of
            the U.S. in the Vietnam War, had their genesis in post-war Germany.
            Fundamental philosophical differences regarding how people should be
            governed, at the root of the conflict in Vietnam, were earlier made
            manifest to the world in post-war Berlin.

            Immediately after Germany's unconditional surrender on May 7, 1945,
            the Soviet Union focused on exacting punishment and reparations for
            atrocities suffered during the German invasion of Russia. The Soviet
            plan included moving skilled workers and other valuable German
            assets to Soviet-controlled countries while leaving the remaining
            German people to fend for themselves with few agricultural,

            The Western Allies, led by the U.S., focused on building up the West
            German state for humanitarian, economic, and political reasons. A
            stable, self-sufficient West Germany could eventually feed itself,
            significantly reducing the money required from other nations to feed
            so many people. The Western Allies also reasoned that a strong West
            Germany would provide a buffer between the Soviet-controlled
            countries and the rest of Europe.

            These conflicting philosophies and ambitions had their focal point

                A short history of the Berlin Brigade was published in this Special Edition of the Berlin Observer (click image on right). The issue was created to introduce Berlin to newly arriving soldiers. It describes the purpose and structure of the Berlin Brigade, its interaction with the other Allies, and what a soldier can expect as he or she serves in Berlin. There are pictures of some interesting sites in and around Berlin like the Congress Hall (built by the U.S. in 1957 for international exhibitions), the Kaiser-Wilhelm memorial church, and the Olympic Stadium, the site of the 1936 Olympic games. There are also pictures of soldiers in action. I am pictured on page 6 of this issue in my sleeping quarters playing guitar. Grand Funk Railroad is pictured on page 5 also playing guitars. The resemblance is uncanny! Since there is mention in this publication of a Johnny Cash concert in September 1972, this special issue must have been published well after I had left.

                I traveled to Frankfurt via a
                commercial jet from JFK Airport in New York. I'm not certain how I got from the Frankfurt airport
                (Rhein-Main-Flughafen in those days) to an Army headquarters building in downtown Frankfurt. I was traveling alone, so I think I must have taken a taxi.
                I remember being driven through the castle-like stone gates of the headquarters building and into the courtyard. It looked very much like (and may have been) the building pictured on the left. Being my first time out of the U.S., I was in awe of the building and, especially, the courtyard. I was in Frankfurt for only a few hours when I was given orders to travel to Berlin and report to the 2nd Battalion, 6th Infantry. The orders included a travel voucher for the  <span class="reflink">

                </span>
                 that regularly traveled between Frankfurt and Berlin. Although I don't have a clear memory of my first trip on this train (see image on right), I do remember one subsequent trip in particular. I was traveling from Berlin to Frankfurt and looking out the window on a very clear cold winter night at an East German landscape of forest and farms beautifully lit by a full moon. In the distance, I could clearly see a train traveling in the opposite direction begin powered by a steam engine. I can still picture the long trail of moonlit smoke trailing from the stack. I remember thinking: “This could be a scene from the 1930s. It’s hard to imagine that just 25 years before, this peaceful landscape was ravaged by war.”
