        <h2>December 10, 1971</h2>
        <h3>Fussball!</h3>
        <p>This game took on an international flavor once when out battalion was en route to our
            bi-annual trip to Hoenfels. We were guests of the German Army (part of the Bundeswehr formed after WW II) as
            a stop-over. Although there were some initial language difficulties, they were soon overcome by the
            international language of beer and fussball. I don't remember who won, but we held our own, on both fronts,
            as I recall.</p>
