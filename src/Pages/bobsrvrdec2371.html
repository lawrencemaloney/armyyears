        <h2>December 23, 1971</h2>
        <h3>Special Edition</h3>
        <p>Even though my journalism career was over by the time this Special Edition was published, I've
            included it here for two reasons: 1) a picture of mine from an earlier article was included at the bottom of
            this page and, 2) if you take close look at the headline at the top of the page, you will see the work of a
            friend of mine, Mike Sowell, who was the Associate Editor. I'm pretty sure his headlines got closer scrutiny
            after this got past the "brass".</p>
