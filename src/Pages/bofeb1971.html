                <h2>February 19, 1971</h2>
                <p>This was an amazing story, only part of which is told in the article. A group of about 300
                    soldiers, recently graduated from Advance Infantry Training, were waiting in a hanger at Travis Air Force
                    Base near San Francisco. An officer came in and had them form into ranks. There was no reason given. The
                    officer divided the group roughly in half, apparently randomly. One group, the ones featured in this story,
                    were told to pick up their gear and get on a
                    plane. They did not know their destination. They ended up in Berlin. All of the remaining soldiers were put
                    on a different plane bound for Vietnam. Stephen Graham, mentioned in the article, and I became friends and
                    worked together. I remember that he was from Texas and was a big Elvis fan.</p>
